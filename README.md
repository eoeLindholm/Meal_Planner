# Meal_Planner
The app was made as a way to dive into learning python while creating a tool that can help in organizing weekly meal planning.

The project uses sqlite to work with a database, to learn the basics of SQL as well.

The goal is an app that yields a planned week of meals, based on the user's preferences and what is discounted in the local supermarket.
